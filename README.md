# ATM-System
Got it 👍 Let’s create a clean and professional **README.md** for your ATM System C++ project.

---

# 🏦 ATM System (C++)

## 📌 Overview

This project is a simple **ATM System implemented in C++** .
The system allows users to:

* Check account balance
* Deposit money
* Withdraw money (with sufficient balance)
* Secure transactions using **PIN verification**

---

## ⚙️ Features

* 🔐 **PIN Verification** – ensures secure access.
* 💰 **Deposit Money** – add funds to your account.
* 💳 **Withdraw Money** – withdraw if balance is available.
* 📊 **Check Balance** – view your current balance.
* **OOP Concepts** – Encapsulation & Abstraction applied.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **C++** (Object-Oriented Programming)
* Standard Input/Output (`iostream`)

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/atif485/ATM-System.git
   cd ATM-System
   ```

2. Compile the program:

   ```bash
   g++ "ATM System.cpp" -o atm
   ```

3. Run the program:

   ```bash
   ./atm
   ```

---

## 📖 Example Output

```
Balance: 7000
Deposited 3000
Withdraw 5000
Balance: 5000
Withdraw 1000
Balance: 4000
```

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

* Understand **Encapsulation** (private variables like PIN and balance).
* Apply **Abstraction** (public methods like `checkBalance()`, `deposit()`, `withdraw()`).
* Implement a **real-world banking simulation** in C++.
